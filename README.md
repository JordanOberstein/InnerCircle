# InnerCircle
 
Based on the 1981 board game inner circle.  I have created a fully functional two player version of the game, however, it is somewhat unintuitive to use in its current state.  I plan on adding a GUI in the future, as well as attempting to solve the game by finding path of play that yields the highest win probability.
